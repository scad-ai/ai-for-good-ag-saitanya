Welcome to our application - Agro Aid.\n
Are you a farmer or a gardening enthusiast? Do you generally face issue with disease/pest attack and nutrient deficiency for your plant? Over time, the severity of these problems has increased and resulted in losses of crop and plants.
    \nAccording to a study by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, the annual crop losses amount to Rs.50,000 crore($500 billion) due to disease attack, pest attack and nutrient deficiency.

\n\n"<i>Concerted efforts are needed to forge an R and D-led strategy to save the loss of crops due to pests, weeds and diseases.</i>"
